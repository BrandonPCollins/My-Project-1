# Waterford Warlords
 Website Project
 
 The Waterford Warlords webpage is one I have designed for a fictional Mixed Martial Arts Club within my home town of Waterford City, whose business model revolves around taking in local talent and building them into professional fighters.
 
 The purpose of the website is to entice users through a range different avenues, including showcasing the wide variety of classes offers, the pedigree and accomplishments of the coaching staff, and various images of current and past members participating in sparring and winning bouts in various disciplines. It is targeted at Martial Artists interested in a career in combat sports, but with some additional words towards a more casual hobbiest with references towards beginner friendly courses.
