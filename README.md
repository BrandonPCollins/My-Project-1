# Waterford Warlords
 Website Project
 
 The Waterford Warlords webpage is one I have designed for a fictional Mixed Martial Arts Club within my home town of Waterford City, whose business model revolves around taking in local talent and building them into professional fighters.
 
 The purpose of the website is to entice users through a range different avenues, including showcasing the wide variety of classes offers, the pedigree and accomplishments of the coaching staff, and various images of current and past members participating in sparring and winning bouts in various disciplines. It is targeted at Martial Artists interested in a career in combat sports, but with some additional words towards a more casual hobbiest with references towards beginner friendly courses.

# Features

Along the top of the index page and the other 3 pages in the naviation bar. It displays the name of club WATERFORD WARLORDS in the top left hand corner, and snapped to the top right of the bage are navigation linkes to each additional webage, Home, Timetable, Gallery, and Sign Up!. As you can see the Home link is underlined as the active page, clearly conveying to the user which section of the site they are currently on. The colors of blue on white were chosen for their clairty and readibility, while also being pertinent to the club's location in Waterford City as these are the county colours.

# Header 

The header begins with a slow zoom of a picture of two men in an amateur kickboxing bout, immediately conveying the purpose of the club, while the zoom creates a dynamism and draws the user in upon opening the webpage. This is accompanied by a blue block containing the gym's name once again, along with the location. This repetition burrows down on the branding of the club, along with the blue colour scheme which once again draws immediate attention to the name and location, while maintaining the connotations created with local sports teams by utilising the colours of white and blue.

# Index Page

Immediately beneath the header I engage in content hinting as discussed in the Structure Plane User Experience Module to entice the user to engage with the website. On opening the site they can instantly view the beginning of the classes offered section. Once they scroll down I re-engage this technique to showcase the Instructors available to them if they join the gym.

Once they have reached the bottom of the page they are then directed to a hyperlink which will bring them straight to the sign-up page. With this design the index page is specifically structured the funnel the user towards singing up for the gym, and thus generating interest and revenue in the club which is its main goal.
