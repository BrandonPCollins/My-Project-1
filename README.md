# Waterford Warlords
 Website Project
 
 The Waterford Warlords webpage is one I have designed for a fictional Mixed Martial Arts Club within my home town of Waterford City, whose business model revolves around taking in local talent and building them into professional fighters.
 
 The purpose of the website is to entice users through a range different avenues, including showcasing the wide variety of classes offers, the pedigree and accomplishments of the coaching staff, and various images of current and past members participating in sparring and winning bouts in various disciplines. It is targeted at Martial Artists interested in a career in combat sports, but with some additional words towards a more casual hobbiest with references towards beginner friendly courses.

# Features

Along the top of the index page and the other 3 pages in the naviation bar. It displays the name of club WATERFORD WARLORDS in the top left hand corner, and snapped to the top right of the bage are navigation linkes to each additional webage, Home, Timetable, Gallery, and Sign Up!. As you can see the Home link is underlined as the active page, clearly conveying to the user which section of the site they are currently on. The colors of blue on white were chosen for their clairty and readibility, while also being pertinent to the club's location in Waterford City as these are the county colours.

# Header 

The header begins with a slow zoom of a picture of two men in an amateur kickboxing bout, immediately conveying the purpose of the club, while the zoom creates a dynamism and draws the user in upon opening the webpage. This is accompanied by a blue block containing the gym's name once again, along with the location. This repetition burrows down on the branding of the club, along with the blue colour scheme which once again draws immediate attention to the name and location, while maintaining the connotations created with local sports teams by utilising the colours of white and blue.

# Index Page

Immediately beneath the header I engage in content hinting as discussed in the Structure Plane User Experience Module to entice the user to engage with the website. On opening the site they can instantly view the beginning of the classes offered section. Once they scroll down I re-engage this technique to showcase the Instructors available to them if they join the gym.

Once they have reached the bottom of the page they are then directed to a hyperlink which will bring them straight to the sign-up page. With this design the index page is specifically structured the funnel the user towards singing up for the gym, and thus generating interest and revenue in the club which is its main goal.

# Sign Up Form

The sign up page is used to get as much information from the client as possible allowing the gym to tailor experiences and packages to best suit them, whether that be weekly, monthly, or yearly memberships. Further I used it to display my capability in employing various kinds of buttons and inputs.

# Timetable 

The timetable page gives details on all the classes a prospective clien can engage with, displaying the information cleanly and easily in the form of a google calendar which I created specifically for this project. It also provides a place for current memebrs to view upcoming classes. Additionally I included a google map to make the location of the gym clear for new clients.

# Gallery

The mosiac gallery is another technique we're using to try and encourage new sign-ups by showcasing a variety of dynamic and exciting images of training within the gym, showcasing the clean and cutting edge facilities from which the club operates.

# Footer 

At the bottom of every page the footer provides essential contact information for the gym so that it is easily and immeidately available no matter which page the user is currently on. Included is the gym's phone number and email adress for direct contact, and also the club's various social media accounts on Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook using icons taken from fontawesome.com.

# Testing

The site was tested in Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge to confirm its usage over multiple browsers. In all of these browsers I extensively tested various aspect ratios to ensure that the page is responsive to various screen sizes and can dynamically resize itself to fit any device upon which it might be viewed. 

Using Codeinstitutes form return https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/ , I confirmed that the form sign-ins saves all pertinent data and that the required fields prevent submission without their inclusion.

Accesibility was testing through Lighthouse in devtools and the Waterford Warlords website scored high in all areas.

Both the HTML and CSS were ran throughteh official W3C and Jigsaw validators respectively. The CSS returned no errors, but the HTML contained several issues which mostly attributable to oversights and earlier versions. These were thusly corrected, except for a warning of a section lacking a header of which I am aware of and is being done intentionally.
